[01:04.51] Foundation crumbled and the roof burned (21)
[01:07.30] I ain't perfect, I was slidin' like a earthworm, loco
[01:10.36] But I never, ever brought the dirt home (On God)
[01:12.83] Man, we both played each other, you was worse, though (21)
[01:15.23] Always blamin' me because I did it first, though (21)

[01:53.23] I sit back and reminisce sometimes (Just
[01:57.46] Be thinkin', you know, 'bout the old days)
[01:59.55] I used to drink my syrup while you drank your wine (My old ways)
[02:03.95] Can't believe what we came to (21)
[02:07.00] You won't believe what the fame do
[02:10.16] We ain't together, any problems, I still came through (Straight up)

[02:42.60]

[02:35.56] Three, four, five, six, seven, eight)
[02:36.94] My shoulder took a lot of tears
[02:38.06] Woulda swore it was a fountain on (Heavy
[02:40.21] Rain, thunderstorm, hail comin', fallin')
[02:42.06] I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the
[02:44.68] Camera's on (Frown on the inside, laugh when the flash on)
[03:13.68] 
[02:51.36] Truly genuine love never really dies
[02:54.65] But lust, infatuation
[02:58.03] And unrevealed attraction are all
[03:02.14] Things that over time rarely survive
